# 🧠 LangChain Agents – Hands-On Tutorials

This directory contains practical, example-driven notebooks to help you get started with **LangChain Agents**—intelligent, reasoning-based AI components that can make decisions, call tools, and complete complex tasks autonomously.

LangChain Agents allow LLMs to **dynamically choose tools, APIs, or chains** based on the user’s query.

## 🧪 What Are Agents?

Agents use language models not just to respond with text, but to:

- Make decisions  
- Plan steps  
- Choose and call tools (APIs, search engines, calculators, databases)  
- Return a final result after executing a multi-step plan

They're useful for:
- Conversational assistants
- AutoGPT-style task solvers
- Data analysis tools
- API orchestrators

## 📖 Learn More About Agents

These notebooks will evolve over time, but until more examples are added, refer to:

🔗 **Official LangChain Agent Docs**  
[https://docs.langchain.com/docs/components/agents/](https://docs.langchain.com/docs/components/agents/)

You'll learn about:
- Agent types (ReAct, Function-Calling, OpenAI Tools Agent)
- Memory and prompt injection
- Tool creation best practices
- Async tool execution
- Multi-agent workflows

## 🛠 Coming Soon

🚧 More notebooks will be added soon, including:

- 🔄 Conversational agent with memory  
- 🧮 Math agent using a calculator tool  
- 📚 Retrieval QA agent (RAG + tools)  
- 🌐 API-based web assistant

Stay tuned and ⭐ star the repository to get updates!
